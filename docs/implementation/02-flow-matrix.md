| FD-16 | L5191–5248, L5820 | Share roles, passcode, expiry, regenerate | share links and guest access | Old link/session rejected after revoke; expiration/passcode enforced |

| FD-18 | L5249–5289 | Global search and notifications | scoped search, notifications | Results link correctly; read state persists |
| FD-19 | L5947–5968 | Guest name gate | current guest sessions | No member privileges; archived/revoked/expired links fail |
| FD-20 | L5969–end placement handlers | Point/region create, drag/resize, tags | region geometry anchored to page/version | Persist geometry; no overlapping accidental comments; cancel creates nothing |
| FD-21 | L5355, L5916 | Attachments and mentions | upload scopes, member resolution, notifications | Attachment authorization; mention recipients belong to workspace |

## Negative journeys

Wrong workspace IDs, guest access to staff routes, assignment to a foreign user, client/project from another tenant, invalid/duplicate tags, null required values, date clearing, archived project writes, expired links, reply-as-root counts, empty searches, CSV formula payloads, upload failures, missing provider configuration, and stale query responses must all have explicit behavior.
