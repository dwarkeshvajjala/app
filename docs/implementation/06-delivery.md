# Delivery and verification ledger

Date: 2026-09-06. This file tracks actual work; specification text alone is not evidence of delivery.

## Sequence

1. **Source and plan:** preserve HTML, index controls/behaviors, document PRD/flows/frontend/backend/database and amend spec index.
2. **Workflow foundation:** statuses, tags, priority, multi-assignee and clearable dates; backward-compatible models; scoped repositories/indexes.
3. **Workspace operations:** clients, project associations/environments/archive/restore, ticket/dashboard/activity APIs.
4. **Dashboard frontend:** draft design, navigation, project views, client UI, workspace ticket views and metadata editing, activity.
5. **Asset and review extension:** private image/PDF projects, persistent region review, sharing/policy enhancements.
6. **Account/provider flows:** profile/preferences/security; genuine AI and billing when provider configuration is available.
7. **Verification:** generated contracts, lint/typecheck/build, meaningful backend privacy/filter/mutation tests, live browser journeys, doc/status reconciliation.

## Current evidence

- Original HTML copied without executing its scripts. Inventory records 112 element IDs, 76 static controls and 158 action attributes including generated markup.
- Inspected existing React router/layout/features, FastAPI module boundaries, Mongo indexes, permissions, comment mutations and test infrastructure.
- Existing `.env.production.example` and `DEPLOYMENT.md` user modifications were present before this work and must be preserved.
- Plans and flow matrix authored before implementation.
- Implemented: workflow fields and filters; clients; project metadata and archive/restore; workspace dashboard, tickets and activity APIs; the Final Draft dashboard shell and project/client/ticket/activity screens; image/PDF asset upload and region review; private signed asset URLs; generated OpenAPI contracts; and the Final Draft documentation set.
- 2026-09-07: added the first global-search slice: a permission-gated, workspace-scoped API for active projects, root comments/tickets, and workspace members; workspace shell search UI with `/`, Cmd/Ctrl+K, and Escape; generated OpenAPI contracts; and the workspace-isolation/empty-query regression coverage. Search uses the bounded strategy in TDR-0013. Exact placed-comment routing, grouping/ranking, client search, and provider-backed text search remain open audit work.
- Frontend verification: `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck build` completed with 9 successful tasks. Vite reports the expected large PDF worker/application chunk warning; the production build succeeds.
- Backend verification: `ruff check app`, `mypy app/`, and `scripts/check_workspace_scoping.py` pass. The focused application suite passes with `37 passed` using isolated MongoDB, Redis and S3-compatible test services. A complete run reached `186 passed`, then 7 realtime assertions and 4 fixture cleanup cases failed after the local `fakeredis` TCP emulator dropped pub/sub connections; the affected product modules were unchanged by this work.
- Source limitations recorded: the reference HTML was indexed without executing its mock scripts, and local browser policy prevented opening the copied `file://` reference for visual inspection. Product behavior was derived from its markup, labels, controls and action inventory, then implemented against the existing code architecture.

## External dependencies and unresolved product decisions

AI provider authorization/configuration; billing provider/prices/webhook credentials; verified guest domain restrictions; real email delivery credentials; password/2FA/SSO policy. Core local implementation can proceed independently. The HTML's simulated accounts, fake 2FA QR, in-memory credits and checkout toasts must never be copied as working product behavior.

## Verification commands

`pnpm turbo run lint typecheck build`; backend `ruff check`, `mypy app/`, `pytest`, `scripts/check_workspace_scoping.py`; regenerate `packages/types` from locally exported FastAPI OpenAPI without requiring a production server. Integration tests require isolated MongoDB, Redis and S3-compatible storage. Record unavailable infrastructure honestly; never substitute test counts from the historical README.
