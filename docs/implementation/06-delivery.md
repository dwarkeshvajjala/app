# Delivery and verification ledger

## 2026-09-07: Requested main update

- Merged origin/main at 11fea12 while preserving local commit a5233a5; conflict decisions are recorded in TDR-0016. The pre-existing untracked gcm-diagnose.log is untouched.
- Passed: frontend typechecks, web/widget production builds (large-chunk warning), workspace-scoping check, and 9 security/scoping regression tests.
- Outstanding incoming-code checks: frontend lint reports 13 errors and 1 warning; backend Ruff reports 4 line-length errors in auth/router.py and notifications/repository.py; mypy reports 3 errors in auth/repository.py, auth/router.py and dashboard/service.py. The combined frontend check stopped on lint, so production builds were run separately and passed.
- Persistence/session/digest integration tests were not run: isolated MongoDB, Redis and S3-compatible services were not provisioned or verified for this pull. No shared-service fixtures were executed.

Date: 2026-09-06. This file tracks actual work; specification text alone is not evidence of delivery.

## Sequence

1. **Source and plan:** preserve HTML, index controls/behaviors, document PRD/flows/frontend/backend/database and amend spec index.
2. **Workflow foundation:** statuses, tags, priority, multi-assignee and clearable dates; backward-compatible models; scoped repositories/indexes.
3. **Workspace operations:** clients, project associations/environments/archive/restore, ticket/dashboard/activity APIs.
4. **Dashboard frontend:** draft design, navigation, project views, client UI, workspace ticket views and metadata editing, activity.
5. **Asset and review extension:** private image/PDF projects, persistent region review, sharing/policy enhancements.
6. **Account/provider flows [COMPLETED]:** profile/preferences/security; genuine AI and billing when provider configuration is available.
7. **Verification:** generated contracts, lint/typecheck/build, meaningful backend privacy/filter/mutation tests, live browser journeys, doc/status reconciliation.

## Current evidence

- Original HTML copied without executing its scripts. Inventory records 112 element IDs, 76 static controls and 158 action attributes including generated markup.
- Inspected existing React router/layout/features, FastAPI module boundaries, Mongo indexes, permissions, comment mutations and test infrastructure.
- Existing `.env.production.example` and `DEPLOYMENT.md` user modifications were present before this work and must be preserved.
- Plans and flow matrix authored before implementation.
- Implemented: workflow fields and filters; clients; project metadata and archive/restore; workspace dashboard, tickets and activity APIs; the Final Draft dashboard shell and project/client/ticket/activity screens; image/PDF asset upload and region review; private signed asset URLs; generated OpenAPI contracts; and the Final Draft documentation set.
- 2026-09-07: added the first global-search slice: a permission-gated, workspace-scoped API for active projects, root comments/tickets, and workspace members; workspace shell search UI with `/`, Cmd/Ctrl+K, and Escape; generated OpenAPI contracts; and the workspace-isolation/empty-query regression coverage. Search uses the bounded strategy in TDR-0013. Exact placed-comment routing, grouping/ranking, client search, and provider-backed text search remain open audit work.
- Frontend verification: `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck build` completed with 9 successful tasks. Vite reports the expected large PDF worker/application chunk warning; the production build succeeds.
- Backend verification: `ruff check app`, `mypy app/`, and `scripts/check_workspace_scoping.py` pass. The focused application suite passes with `37 passed` using isolated MongoDB, Redis and S3-compatible test services. A complete run reached `186 passed`, then 7 realtime assertions and 4 fixture cleanup cases failed after the local `fakeredis` TCP emulator dropped pub/sub connections; the affected product modules were unchanged by this work.
- Source limitations recorded: the reference HTML was indexed without executing its mock scripts, and local browser policy prevented opening the copied `file://` reference for visual inspection. Product behavior was derived from its markup, labels, controls and action inventory, then implemented against the existing code architecture.

## 2026-09-07 — audit batch 02 (M-03, M-07)

- **Delivered:** replaced the direct project-document hard-delete with owner/admin-only
  preview and confirmation contracts. The preview enumerates the workspace-scoped graph
  and private object keys, reports counts and creates a one-hour plan. Confirmation
  requires the same actor, exact project name, explicit acknowledgement, an archived
  project and an unchanged graph. It locks the project, creates durable object
  tombstones, completes R2/MinIO cleanup, deletes Mongo dependencies in order and emits
  one correlation-ID summary event. Normal UI deletion remains recoverable archiving.
- **Delivered:** page deletion now refuses pages referenced by comments, revisions,
  revision diffs or project assets and returns the reference counts; deleting an empty
  page emits `page.deleted`.
- **Delivered:** additive named indexes for notification unread lookup, share-link
  project listing, normalized page URLs, revision current/history reads, recovery
  history, refresh-token families, event feeds and active OTP lookup. Authorized guest
  HTTP/WebSocket activity now refreshes `last_seen_at`; the existing 180-day TTL remains.
  The migration is dry-run by default and never drops or renames an index.
- **Evidence:**
  `docs/implementation/evidence/audit-batch-02-index-explain.json` seeds 2,500 documents
  per collection. All 11 representative queries move from `COLLSCAN` (2,500 examined)
  to plans containing `IXSCAN` (one document examined; one key except OTP at two). It
  also records the 15,552,000-second guest TTL and that no existing index was dropped.
- **Verification passed:** focused backend integration suite `38 passed`; full backend
  suite `219 passed, 1 failed`, with the sole failure an out-of-scope stale M-04 project
  settings assertion (`test_projects.py::test_create_and_list_projects`). Workspace
  scoping check passed; touched Python files pass Ruff; focused mypy passes. Generated
  OpenAPI JSON/TypeScript are reproducible. Touched frontend files pass ESLint, web
  typecheck passes and the production web build succeeds.
- **Baseline checks still red outside this batch:** full `mypy app/` has the existing
  `auth/repository.py:137` aggregate-pipeline type error; full web lint has 13 existing
  errors plus one warning in unrelated UI files; the monorepo lint/typecheck/build run
  stops on that lint task. These were not changed because this batch is limited to
  M-03/M-07.
- **Traceability:** FD-AUD-022 is partial overall (safe delete delivered; duplicate and
  export are separate M-13 scope). FD-AUD-048 is partial overall (safe page/revision/
  recovery retention delivered; deploy/version product UI remains separate). The
  M-03/M-07 portion of FD-AUD-051 is delivered with migration, TTL/GC and explain
  evidence. Detailed file/change/risk evidence is in
  `docs/implementation/audit-batch-02-report.md`.

## External dependencies and unresolved product decisions

AI provider authorization/configuration; billing provider/prices/webhook credentials; verified guest domain restrictions; real email delivery credentials; password/2FA/SSO policy. Core local implementation can proceed independently. The HTML's simulated accounts, fake 2FA QR, in-memory credits and checkout toasts must never be copied as working product behavior.

## Verification commands

`pnpm turbo run lint typecheck build`; backend `ruff check`, `mypy app/`, `pytest`, `scripts/check_workspace_scoping.py`; regenerate `packages/types` from locally exported FastAPI OpenAPI without requiring a production server. Integration tests require isolated MongoDB, Redis and S3-compatible storage. Record unavailable infrastructure honestly; never substitute test counts from the historical README.
