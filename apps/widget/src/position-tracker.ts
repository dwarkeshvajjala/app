// Keeps a pin visually attached to its target element even while that element itself
// moves - a CSS transform/animation-driven carousel or marquee, for instance, where the
// element never leaves the DOM (so resolveAnchorElement/the click's own element
// reference keeps finding it) but its on-screen position changes every frame, unrelated
// to page scroll (which position:absolute + pageX/pageY already handle - see ui.ts).
// Without this, a pin captured the moment its card was under the cursor stays glued to
// that now-stale page position forever, and a completely different card ends up
// visually "owning" the comment once the animation moves on.
//
// Also hides the pin while its target is scrolled out of the viewport entirely
// (intersectsViewport below), rather than letting it trail along above/below the
// visible area as the page scrolls - a real complaint found by hand: a pin on a card
// that scrolled away stayed visible flying up/down the page after it, looking broken,
// instead of just disappearing until that card scrolls back into view.
//
// One shared requestAnimationFrame loop for every tracked pin (not one loop per pin) -
// a page with several comments open at once still only pays for a single rAF callback,
// which just iterates the tracked set and re-reads each target's own
// getBoundingClientRect(). A dirty-check (only touching the DOM when the position
// actually changed) keeps a page with zero moving elements essentially free after the
// first frame.

// screen. So a target with zero overlap with the current viewport is treated the same
// as "can't be found" - hidden - and reappears the moment it scrolls back into view.

/**
 * `resolve` is called every frame to get the current live element - a direct element
 * reference for a pin just created this session (`() => target`), or
 * `resolveAnchorElement(anchor)` for one loaded from the server. `onUpdate` fires only
 * when the resolved element's position actually changes, with `null` if the element
 * currently can't be found at all (e.g. removed from the DOM) *or* is scrolled
 * completely outside the viewport - callers typically hide the pin in that case rather
 * than leaving it at its last known position or letting it trail off past the edge of
 * the screen. Returns a function that stops tracking - call it when the pin itself is
 * removed.
