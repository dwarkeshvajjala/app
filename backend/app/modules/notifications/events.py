"""Canonical notification `type` values - M-06 (FD-AUD-006/038): these were previously
inline string literals repeated at each notify_* call site (`type="comment_assigned"`,
etc.), the same drift risk `comments/events.py` already guards against for the `events`
collection's `type` field. Every value here must stay in sync with
`notifications/schemas.py`'s `NotificationType` Literal - that's the wire contract;
these constants are what code should reference instead of retyping the string."""
