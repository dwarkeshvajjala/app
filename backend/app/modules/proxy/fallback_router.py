    """Guest-facing safety net for a gap `docs/tdr/0008` already documents as
    deliberately out of scope: the proxy's HTML rewriter only rewrites `href`/`src`/
    `action` attributes present in the server-rendered markup (modules/proxy/rewriter.py)
    - it can't touch a target site's own client-side JS (a live search box doing
    `location.href = "/search?q=..."` on Enter, or markup a client-rendered widget
    injects after the initial load). That still causes a real top-level browser
    navigation, which lands here as a request straight to this API's own origin/root
    instead of through `/proxy/{token}/...`, since the JS built an absolute path with no
    idea it's running inside a proxy.

    A real fix is the service-worker-based interception `docs/tdr/0008` scoped out as a
    multi-week project. This is a much smaller, safe stopgap: the browser's own Referer
    header still carries the `/proxy/{token}/...` page the navigation started from, so
    when it does, redirect back through that same token instead of surfacing a bare
    404 - the common "typed into the reviewed site's own search box" case. Registered
    last (app/main.py) so it only ever catches requests no other route matched; anything
    without a recognizable proxy Referer still 404s, just with this API's normal JSON
    error envelope instead of Starlette's default `{"detail": "..."}` body.
