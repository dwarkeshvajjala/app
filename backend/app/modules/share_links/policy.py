"""M-02: centralized share-link policy enforcement.

`ask_reviewer_name`, `domain_restrictions`, and `comment_export_permission` are stored
on every share_links document (share_links/schemas.py, share_links/repository.py) but
were previously write-only - nothing ever read them back at the points that matter
(guest-session creation, export). This module is the single place those checks live,
per the audit's "centralize check_share_policy()... apply at every relevant operation"
instruction (07-html-parity-audit M-02) - callers must not hand-roll an equivalent
if-check inline (Rule 3, Single Source of Truth, same principle as core/permissions.py).

`reviewer_can_resolve` and `show_board_to_client` are intentionally NOT enforced here:
13-Authentication.md §13.5's permission matrix hardcodes "Change comment status/assignee:
No (never)" for guests, and there is no guest-facing board endpoint in this codebase to
gate at all. Wiring either up would be new product scope requiring its own TDR, not a
policy-enforcement bugfix - see docs/implementation/audit-batch-01-report.md.
