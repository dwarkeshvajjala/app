"""Single Arq worker entrypoint (06-Backend-Architecture.md §6.5). Run locally with:

    uv run arq app.workers.main.WorkerSettings

One process registering every background job function, rather than one process per
module - the realistic production shape (most teams run one or a small, fixed number of
worker processes, not one per feature area). Each job function itself is a thin wrapper;
the actual logic lives in the relevant module's service.py as a plain, directly-testable
async function - this file is the only place that knows about Arq's `ctx`/registration/
cron mechanics.
