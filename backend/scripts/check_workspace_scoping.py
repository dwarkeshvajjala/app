"""Workspace-scoping lint rule (06-Backend-Architecture.md §6.4, Milestone 11).

Rule 6 (Security Is a Feature) requires every query against tenant-owned data to be
workspace-scoped. In practice, most repository methods in this codebase don't filter by
`workspace_id` directly - they filter by `_id` (or another foreign key that is itself a
globally-unique ObjectId, like `page_id`/`project_id`/`share_link_id`) and rely on the
calling service having already verified that id belongs to the caller's workspace
earlier in the same request (the "find-by-id-then-verify-then-mutate" pattern used
throughout `modules/*/service.py`). That's a legitimate, deliberately-chosen pattern,
not a bug - but it means a naive "every query must literally contain workspace_id"
check would fail on dozens of correct call sites.

So: this script flags any `db.<collection>.<find|find_one|update_one|update_many|
delete_one|delete_many|count_documents>(...)` call in `app/modules/**/repository.py`
whose filter dict has no `workspace_id` key, UNLESS either (a) the collection is in
`GLOBAL_COLLECTIONS` (not tenant-owned at all - users, refresh_tokens, otp_codes,
workspaces themselves; 03-System-Architecture.md §3.5's explicit exemption), or (b) the
call has a `# workspace-scope-exempt: <reason>` comment on the same line or the line
directly above it, explaining why the filter is safe without workspace_id (e.g. "id
already verified against workspace_id in the calling service").

This makes every exemption an explicit, reviewed, in-code decision instead of a silent
gap - a new query that forgets workspace_id fails CI until a human either adds the
scope or writes down why it doesn't need it.
